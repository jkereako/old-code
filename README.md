# Old code
This is my very first attempt at iOS development in 2010.

I began learning in mid 2009 and gave it up in mid 2011. Not once during this process did I lay eyes on Apple's documentation. Instead, I decided to learn the hard way by reading opinionated blogs and 1 book by BigNerdRanch. I'd often get fed up and move on to another technology.

Although there is a lot of code here, I understood very little of it (hence minimal documentation). This is a prime example of [cargo cult programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming). I copied most of this code from StackOverflow and blogs.

Don't make this mistake. Read Apple's documentation.
